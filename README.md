# SCCT-Linux-Patch
Simple script to "patch" Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory running through Wine/Proton to have true widescreen, better shadows, no mouse acceleration and no intro videos. Only tested with the Steam version.

# Usage:
put script inside the main game folder (NOT the System folder) and run.

## The script needs these programs installed to function:
```hexdump sed xxd wget```
